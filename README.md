# Unity Procedural Walker

**Unity Procedural Walker** is a project developed using the Unity game engine that demonstrates procedural animation techniques for creating a walking character. This project showcases advanced animation and procedural generation methods within Unity.

## Key Components

### Scripts

#### WalkerController.cs
- **Procedural Animation:** Manages the procedural generation of the walking animation for the character.
- **Movement Logic:** Controls the character's movement and walking mechanics.

#### LegController.cs
- **Limb Coordination:** Handles the coordination and animation of the character's legs.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Adjusts leg movements based on the terrain and character's speed.

### Features

- **Procedural Walking:** Implements procedural techniques to generate realistic walking animations.
- **Dynamic Terrain Interaction:** Ensures smooth and adaptive walking on various terrains.
- **Advanced Animation:** Utilizes Unity's animation capabilities to enhance the realism of character movement.

This project serves as an excellent example for developers interested in creating advanced procedural animations and character movements using Unity.
